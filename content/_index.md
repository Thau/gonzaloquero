## Who am I?

I am Gonzalo Quero, a 35 years old Spanish software developer. I currently live in London, UK, and work as a Senior Developer at [DRW](https://drw.com/).

## What do I do?

I am a generalist programmer, give me a problem and I'll do my best to solve it, though most of my professional experience has been in the fields of Web Development, VFX Helper Software, and Video Games. Look at my [Portfolio](/portfolio) to see some examples of my work.
