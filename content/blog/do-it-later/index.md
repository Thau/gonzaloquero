Dear Microsoft and other software companies,

when setting up my device, or in general using any software, if I get presented
with a choice to enable some functionality, I want three options: "No", "Yes",
"Maybe Later". Having just "Yes" and "Maybe Later" is a dark pattern and should
be a source of shame for whoever implements it.

This comes, by the way, because of the latest Windows 10 update. This morning I
was presented with a dialog asking for my phone number, which I don't want to
give to Microsoft. I was only given the options "Yes" and "Do it later", as if
the software is presuming I'll just do it at some point, like "No" was never an
option.

I know these patterns "convert" and sell, but they're just shamefully immoral.

Anyway, keep developing!
