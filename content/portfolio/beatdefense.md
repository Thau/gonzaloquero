## Description
Retro rhythm game. The player must stop missiles that are falling on a city, touching them to the beat of the music.

## Technology
Made on Unity3D, with 2D Toolkit for sprite management and uGUI for the UI. I made a custom shader that uses a normal map to make a pixelated day - night effect.
